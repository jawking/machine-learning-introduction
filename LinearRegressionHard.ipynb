    "The task of supervised learning is to train a model to predict a label $y$ given an input $x = (x_1, x_2, \\dotsc, x_n)$, where $n$ is the number of input features. For example, $y$ as the target variable can be the price of a house, and $x$ is a vector consisting of $n$ features of the house, such as: the number of bedrooms, proximity to public transport, age of house, etc... Our task then is to build a model that can take these input features of the house and predict the price that the house will be sold at. \n",

    "To train a supervised machine-learning algorithm, you would need a bunch of labelled examples $\\{(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)}, y^{(2)}), \\dotsc, (x^{(m)}, y^{(m)})\\}$ which we call the **training data**, where $m$ is the number of datapoints. Using the above example, we would need a dataset containing the sold price of $m$ houses, along with the $n$ features for each of those houses.\n",
