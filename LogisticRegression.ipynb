    "# Programming Exercise 2: Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on the [Coursera Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course by Andrew Ng. We believe it is the best course for people who are keen to make their first steps in Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is taught in Octave / MATLAB, but Python is much more broadly used in the industry and academia. We have used and modified a Python implementation from [David Kaleko](https://github.com/kaleko). \n",
    "\n",
    "Explanations of the model, and any mistakes herein, are of our own doing. If you're unsure about anything, feel free to ask us during the session!\n",
